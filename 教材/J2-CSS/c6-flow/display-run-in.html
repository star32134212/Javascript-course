<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#run-in-boxes">A run-in box behaves as follows:</a>
<ol>
<li>If the run-in box contains a block box, the run-in box becomes a block box.</li>
<li>If a sibling block box (that does not float and is not absolutely positioned) follows the run-in box, the run-in box becomes the first inline box of the block box. A run-in cannot run in to a block that already starts with a run-in or that itself is a run-in.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the run-in box becomes a block box.</li>
</ol>
Example:
<xmp>
    <style type="text/css">
      H3 { display: run-in }
    </style>
    <h3>A run-in heading.</h3>
    <p> And a paragraph of text that follows it.</p>
